# Titanic_LogisticRegression
Code a Logistic Regression Algorithm to predict whether or not a passenger survives Titanic

Click here to view my jupyter notebook interactively: 

This project will work through the definition of a Logistic Regression function in Python. After a summary of the equations that will be used, and a brief EDA of the "Titanic" data we will be using, you will be asked to define a number of functions which will, in sum, create a Logistic Regression. A demonstration of sklearn's implementation of Logistic Regression will be executed at the end of the project.

Code functions to do the following:

1. Implement the Logistic Regression Algorithm
2. Calculate the value of the sigmoid function
3. Calculate the gradient of the log-likelihood with respect to  ùë§ 
4. Sum the gradients of the log-likelihood with respect to  ùë§ 
5. Execute logistic regression, stopping after a particular iteration
6. Determine convergence of the logistic regression algorithm
